## SAP Movement Types

### 261 (FrontFlush) - Goods Issue for Production

**Purpose**: Issue materials from storage to production

**Workflow**:

2. Select SAP Movement Type: "261 (FrontFlush)"
3. Link to Work Order (optional but recommended)
4. Add items from Raw Material warehouses to WIP warehouses
5. Submit for warehouse supervisor approval
6. Warehouse supervisor provides digital signature
7. System automatically submits and generates GI/GT slip

**Example Scenario**:
```
Scenario: Issue steel plates for manufacturing
Source: Raw Material Main - AMB-W
Target: Production WIP - AMB-W
Work Order: WO-2024-001
Required Signature: Warehouse Supervisor only
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Source warehouse must be "Raw Material" or "Work In Progress" type
- Target warehouse must be "Work In Progress" type
- Warehouse supervisor signature required
- Purpose must be "Material Issue"

### 311 (BackFlush) - Transfer for Kitting

**Purpose**: Transfer materials from production to kitting area

**Workflow**:
1. Create Stock Entry with Purpose: "Material Transfer"
2. Select SAP Movement Type: "311 (BackFlush)"
3. Link to Work Order for zone tracking
4. Add items from WIP warehouses to Kitting warehouses
5. Submit for warehouse supervisor approval
6. Warehouse supervisor provides digital signature
7. Submit for kitting supervisor approval
8. Kitting supervisor provides digital signature
9. System submits and generates GI/GT slip

**Example Scenario**:
```
Scenario: Transfer assembled components for final kitting
Source: Production WIP - AMB-W
Target: Kitting Area - AMB-W
Work Order: WO-2024-001
Required Signatures: Warehouse Supervisor + Kitting Supervisor
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Source warehouse must be "Work In Progress" type
- Target warehouse must be "Work In Progress" or "Kitting" type
- Both warehouse and kitting supervisor signatures required
- Purpose must be "Material Transfer"

## Dual-Signature Workflow

### Workflow States

1. **Draft**: Initial creation by user
2. **Pending Warehouse Approval**: Awaiting warehouse supervisor signature
3. **Warehouse Approved**: First signature obtained
4. **Kitting Approved**: Final approval (SAP 311 only)
5. **Rejected**: Returned for revision

### Signature Process

**For Warehouse Supervisors**:
1. Navigate to Stock Entry list
2. Filter by "Pending Warehouse Approval"
3. Open Stock Entry
4. Review items and warehouses
5. Scroll to "Dual Signature Approval" section
6. Click in "Warehouse Supervisor Signature" field
7. Provide digital signature using stylus or finger
8. Click "Warehouse Approve" action
9. Confirm approval

**For Kitting Supervisors** (SAP 311 only):
1. Filter Stock Entries by "Warehouse Approved"
2. Open Stock Entry
3. Verify warehouse supervisor signature
4. Review kitting requirements
5. Provide signature in "Kitting Supervisor Signature" field
6. Click "Kitting Approve" action
7. Confirm final approval

### Signature Validation

- Signatures are timestamped automatically
- Empty signatures are rejected
- Role validation ensures proper authority
- Audit trail maintained for compliance

## Zone Status Management

### Understanding Zone Status

**Red Zone** üî¥
- Incomplete material availability
- Work Order cannot proceed with production
- Material shortages require attention
- Displayed with red color coding

**Green Zone** üü¢
- All materials available for production
- Work Order ready to begin
- 100% material completion achieved
- Displayed with green color coding

### Zone Status Calculation

**Automatic Calculation**:
1. System reads Work Order BOM requirements
2. Checks actual stock in specified warehouses
3. Calculates availability percentage
4. Updates zone status based on threshold:
   - 100% availability = Green Zone
   - < 100% availability = Red Zone

**Manual Updates**:
```python
# Via API call
frappe.call({
    method: 'rnd_warehouse_management.warehouse_management.work_order.update_work_order_zone_status',
    args: { work_order_name: 'WO-2024-001' }
})
```

### Zone Status Monitoring

**Dashboard Indicators**:
- Work Order list shows zone status column
- Color-coded badges for quick identification
- Completion percentage displayed
- Last update timestamp

**Material Status Details**:
1. Open Work Order
2. Click "Check Material Status" button
3. Review detailed material availability
4. Identify specific shortages
5. Plan procurement or production accordingly

### Zone Transitions

**Red to Green Transition**:
- Triggered by stock replenishment
- Automatic when all materials available
- Email notifications to production team
- Work Order becomes production-ready

**Green to Red Transition**:
- Occurs when materials consumed
- Stock falls below BOM requirements
- Immediate notification to procurement
- Production planning adjustment needed

## GI/GT Slip Operations

### Automatic Generation

**When Generated**:
- Upon final workflow approval
- Unique slip number assigned (GI-GT-XXXXX)
- Timestamp recorded
