# Phase 2 Optional Enhancements - Implementation Plan

## Tasks Overview

### Task 5: Approval Dashboard (Custom Page)
**Objective**: Create a centralized approval management interface

**Deliverables**:
1. Custom Page: `approval_dashboard`
2. Vue.js component for interactive dashboard
3. Backend API endpoints for dashboard data
4. Features:
   - My Pending Approvals (requires action)
   - Approvals I've Granted/Rejected
   - Filter by movement type, date range, status
   - Bulk approval actions
   - Quick view/approve/reject from dashboard

**Files to Create**:
- `rnd_warehouse_management/warehouse_management/page/approval_dashboard/approval_dashboard.json`
- `rnd_warehouse_management/warehouse_management/page/approval_dashboard/approval_dashboard.py`
- `rnd_warehouse_management/warehouse_management/page/approval_dashboard/approval_dashboard.js`
- `rnd_warehouse_management/warehouse_management/page/approval_dashboard/approval_dashboard.html`

### Task 6: Enhanced Client-Side UX
**Objective**: Improve Stock Entry form with workflow visualization

**Deliverables**:
1. Workflow Timeline Component
   - Visual representation of approval levels
   - Current status indicator
   - Approval history with timestamps
   - Approver names and comments
   - Color-coded status (pending, approved, rejected)

2. Enhanced Form Actions
   - Inline approve/reject buttons
   - Comment dialog
   - Signature capture modal
   - Status badges

**Files to Modify**:
- `rnd_warehouse_management/public/js/stock_entry.js` (client-side form script)
- Create new: `rnd_warehouse_management/public/js/approval_workflow_ui.js`
- Create new: `rnd_warehouse_management/public/css/approval_workflow.css`

### Task 7: Auto-Escalation Logic
**Objective**: Automated escalation for overdue approvals

**Deliverables**:
1. Scheduled Task
   - Runs daily at 9 AM
   - Checks all pending approvals
   - Identifies overdue items based on `escalation_days` in approval rules
   - Sends escalation notifications to:
     - Original approver (reminder)
     - Next level approver (escalation)
     - System admins (if critical)

2. Escalation API Functions
   - `check_overdue_approvals()`
   - `escalate_approval(stock_entry_name, reason)`
   - `send_escalation_notification()`

**Files to Modify/Create**:
- `rnd_warehouse_management/rnd_warehouse_management/hooks.py` (add scheduled task)
- `rnd_warehouse_management/warehouse_management/stock_entry.py` (add escalation functions)

## Implementation Order

1. **Task 7: Auto-Escalation** (Backend - Foundation)
2. **Task 6: Enhanced UX** (Frontend - Core User Interface)
3. **Task 5: Approval Dashboard** (Frontend - Advanced Feature)

## Testing Plan

After all enhancements are implemented:

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Task 7 Testing**:
- [ ] Create approval with escalation days set to 0 (immediate)
- [ ] Run scheduled task manually
- [ ] Verify escalation notification sent
- [ ] Verify audit log created for escalation

**Task 6 Testing**:
- [ ] Open Stock Entry form
- [ ] Verify workflow timeline displays correctly
- [ ] Request approval and verify UI updates
- [ ] Approve at Level 1 and verify timeline progression
- [ ] Test inline approve/reject buttons
- [ ] Test comment dialog

**Task 5 Testing**:
- [ ] Access Approval Dashboard from menu
- [ ] Verify pending approvals display
- [ ] Test filters (movement type, date, status)
- [ ] Test quick approve from dashboard
- [ ] Test bulk approve action
- [ ] Verify "My History" tab shows past approvals

### Integration Testing

**Complete Phase 2 Workflow**:
1. Create approval rules for Movement Type 261 (2 levels)
2. Create Stock Entry and request approval
3. Verify workflow timeline shows pending status
4. Check Approval Dashboard shows pending item
5. Approve from dashboard
6. Verify timeline updates in real-time
7. Let approval become overdue
8. Run escalation task
9. Verify escalation notification
10. Approve at final level
11. Verify complete audit trail
